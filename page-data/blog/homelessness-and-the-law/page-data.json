The imposed four-week overnight curfew saw Quebecers needing to stay home between 8 p.m. and 5 a.m., with few exceptions. This included those who were experiencing homelessness, as Legault argued because of the cold, they should seek indoor shelter, and that “there is enough room available.\\\" Local advocates in the community, such as Nakuset, quickly spoke up in response to Legault’s comments, calling them “tone-deaf” for expecting homeless individuals to follow curfew. \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"Not only do individuals experiencing homelessness have to endure the very condition of homelessness, but also the discriminatory nature of the law. Nakuset’s fears were that police would fine homeless people, because they would be breaking the curfew. Geneviève Guilbault, Quebec's public security minister, stated the police would act with “appreciation” and “judgment” before ticketing a homeless person (the main goal ultimately to help find them a place). This example showcases the way in which the homeless population in Canada experiences discrimination, inadequate protective legislation, and lack of consideration when it comes to the law. \",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"While services like shelters and food programs tend to the immediate needs of individuals experiencing homelessness, it fails to prevent and transfer individuals out of this situation.

Upon release, they usually either stay with family or friends temporarily, or go to a shelter, but inevitably, they do not have money or clean attire, leading some to quickly re-offend for the sole reason of trying to survive.
